# The Footy Forte

This  repository contains the code and data to replicate the experiments in the thesis The Footy Forte: Factors impacting team strengths in the Australian Football League. The thesis focuses on estimating team strengths and predicting game results in advance in the Australian Football League.

This code was made by Carlos Rafael Gonz√°lez Soffner. Anyone is welcome to
use this file or any part of it for their projects as long as they reference
this thesis, code or author.

Bests,

Carlos.

## Usage

### Fetching Data
Download *FETCHING_RESULTS_AND_LADDER.Rmd* and run the chunks in R Studio to retrieve the data used in this thesis. The data is also available in the folder *FETCHED DATA*.
  
  - LADDER_15TO23.csv: Ladder results, seasons 2015-23
  - PIS_15TO23.csv: Performance Indicator data, seasons 2015-23
  - last_ladder_position.xlsx: Final ladder position from the previous season, for seasons 2012-23
  - results_afl_tables_12TO23.csv: Game results, seasons 2012-23

Download *DATA PROCESSING.ipynb* and run the cells to perform the data processing for the different Bradley-Terry models. The processed data can also be found in the following folders.

  - *ST_DATA*: Datasets to fit the standard and contest-specific expansions of the Bradley-Terry model. One for each season and all the available data (2015-23, labelled as 2024)
  - *ST_DATA_TEST*: Test datasets for the standard and contest-specific expansions of the Bradley-Terry model. One for each season and all the available data (2015-23, labelled as 2024).
  - *TS_TV_DATA*: Datasets to fit the team-specific, time-variant expansion of the Bradley-Terry model. One for each season, separated by Home and Away teams and for both encodings of cumulatives (L4, ALL). There is also one dataset with all the available data (2015-23, labelled as FULL).

Download *BT_BASELINE_23_TRIAL.Rmd* and run the chunks in R Studio to replicate the results of the standard and contest-specific expansions of the Bradley-Terry model.

Download *TS_TV_BT.Rmd* and run the chunks in R Studio to replicate the results of the steam-specific, time-variant expansion of the Bradley-Terry model, and the results of the round-by-round predictions.
